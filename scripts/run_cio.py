"""On-demand CIO / Meta-PM weekly review.

Reads the Flagship desk's accountability state — per-role calibration multipliers, each seat's graded
KPIs, book NAV-vs-benchmark, and the shadow leaderboard — and writes a "what is working / who is
miscalibrated" note plus non-binding tuning recommendations to data/brain/cio/<isoweek>.{json,md}.

It RECOMMENDS ONLY: it never trades, never flips a flag, and never changes any seat's behavior. The
numbers + recommendations are computed deterministically; Opus only writes the prose note. Safe to run
in the weekly scheduler or by hand.
