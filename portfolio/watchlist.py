"""Flagship WATCHLIST — the parked-name backstop for the subtract-only entry-timing gate.

A prototype of the first-class WATCH state from the buy-pipeline design
(``docs/design/desk/03-buy-pipeline-and-watchlist.md`` §3.6): a name the engine would otherwise
BUY but whose entry technicals are poor is not bought — it is PARKED here for daily re-review
instead of being force-bought at a bad entry. This module is deliberately minimal: an append-only,
idempotent-per-(ticker, date) JSONL log plus a tiny read API. It owns NO sizing and NEVER touches
prod trading state; the gate in ``bot.phase2`` only ever WITHHOLDS (subtract-only) and records here.

The timing predicate (``timing_withhold``) is the EXACT mirror of the shadow lever
``portfolio.desk_ab.apply_timing_gated`` / ``_timing_ok`` (AB_EXPERIMENT.md §2.4) so the live gate
and the forward A/B arm gate identically: withhold iff
  * extension grade ∈ {stretched, parabolic, extended}  OR the parabolic flag is set, OR
  * pct_vs_200dma >= 30, OR
  * rs < 50, OR
  * urgency == 'avoid', OR
  * eq_grade == 'weak'.
Every field is nullable; a missing field never fires (fail-open) so an absent snapshot can never
silently withhold a name — matching ``_timing_ok``'s fail-open contract.
