"""Prophet feed — an ADDITIVE candidate source + plan-geometry chase guard for the conviction sleeve.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The Macro Dashboard's "US Prophet" system publishes nightly trade PLANS — each a full
entry/trigger/invalidation/target geometry for one equity, pre-gated upstream by the macro
engine's confluence tiers (insider + earnings-surprise + revisions read together, not a lone
alpha). We vendor its emit on disk at ``vendor/macro/site/prophet/index.json`` (schema
``prophet.index/v1``) and expose it here as ONE more place the conviction gate can DISCOVER a
name, plus a deterministic guard that answers *"given this plan's own geometry, is the current
price still a buyable entry or have we missed / over-chased the move?"*.

WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY — the load-bearing invariants
-------------------------------------------------------
  * ADDITIVE ONLY (charter P2 / doc §2.3, §3). This module SOURCES candidates and DESCRIBES
    geometry. It sizes nothing, gates nothing, and casts no vote. ``candidate_tickers()`` only
    ever *adds* names for the downstream conviction gate to filter — the gate still decides, and
    a Prophet plan can never buy through a failed quality/entry/context assessor. The doctrine is
    explicit that the artifact is DISPLAY-TIER: "no signal has passed a forward ledger gate; the
    word 'validated' is forbidden in user-facing text." Nothing here escalates it past display.
  * FAIL-OPEN EVERYWHERE. Every public function returns an inert default (``{}`` / ``[]`` /
    ``None`` / a ``no_plan`` dict) when the artifact is absent, malformed, stale, or the flag is
    OFF — and NEVER raises. A missing signal must inform nothing; it can never manufacture a
    veto, a withhold, or a fabricated plan. (In a fresh worktree the vendored file is commonly a
    dangling symlink into the R2 data plane and simply absent — that MUST degrade silently.)
  * STALENESS IS A HARD GATE. The plans carry entry/trigger/invalidation PRICES; acting on a
    week-old geometry against today's tape is how you knife into a name whose plan already
    invalidated. Top-level ``asof`` older than ``_STALE_DAYS`` calendar days → the whole feed goes
    inert (``index()`` returns ``{}``), exactly as ``brain/neural_web_context`` treats its context.
  * INJECTABLE FOR TESTS. The artifact path is a module-level ``_ARTIFACT_PATH`` derived from the
    ``_V`` vendor root (same convention as ``portfolio/lenses`` and ``brain/neural_web_context``),
    and the read is cached per-process with an explicit ``_reset_cache()`` — so a test can write a
    fixture to ``tmp_path``, monkeypatch ``_ARTIFACT_PATH``/``_V``, reset the cache, and exercise
    the full logic offline with no vendor engine and no network.

REAL-SCHEMA NOTES (verified against the 2026-07-18 vendor artifact — deviations from the naive
expectation are handled here, NOT papered over):
  * ``targets`` is a FLAT list of prices ``[t1, t2]`` — NOT a list of ``{label, price}`` objects.
    The LABELLED T1/T2 levels live in a SEPARATE ``profit_plan`` array whose items are
    ``{level, label, action, status}`` (the price key is ``level``, not ``price``). So t1/t2 are
    resolved by label from ``profit_plan`` first, falling back to ``targets`` by index order.
  * The signal date field is ``_signal_date`` (underscore-prefixed), and conviction is
    ``_conviction_score`` (underscore-prefixed). We read both, with a bare-name fallback so a
    future un-prefixed emit still resolves.
  * There is NO ``rr_grade`` (nor any letter grade) in the artifact. The nearest analogs are the
    numeric ``_r_unit`` (dollar R-size) and ``management_confidence``. ``rr_grade`` is therefore
    normalized to ``None`` (defensively coerced) — we never fabricate a grade. Downstream should
    treat it as informational-only and absent in this schema version.
  * Observed ``recommended_action`` values: hold | wait | trim | invalidated. Observed ``phase``
    values: pre_trigger | triggered_pre_t1 | overtime | invalidated. The enter/expired/closed/trail
    values named in the program spec are handled for forward-compatibility though absent today.
