"""US equity market clock — is the regular session open right now?

Drives the Self-Directed book's order routing: an order placed while the market is
OPEN fills immediately at the live price; one placed while it is CLOSED is queued
PENDING and fills at the next session's OPEN price.

Deliberately dependency-free: US-Eastern wall-clock is computed from UTC with a manual
DST rule (no `zoneinfo`/tzdata required, so it can't crash on a minimal host). Regular
session = 09:30–16:00 ET, Mon–Fri, excluding the NYSE full-day holidays below. Early-close
days (e.g. the day after Thanksgiving) are treated as normal sessions — the 1pm close is
immaterial to this paper book's EOD-grade marks. Every public fn accepts an optional `now`
(a naive ET datetime) so callers/tests can pin the clock.
