"""Outcome ledger — the per-thesis reliability + LENS-EDGE substrate (the self-calibrating gate's input).

Coexists with, and is complementary to, brain/calibration.py (which de-confidences agents with a
shrink-only multiplier). This module does the OTHER half of closing the perception-to-outcome loop:
when a thesis resolves, it records a row joining three things the engine otherwise never connects:
  1. what it PREDICTED   — prob_correct + the falsifier (brain/decision, brain/ledger),
  2. what HAPPENED        — realized rel-return vs SPY and the hit/miss (brain/outcomes.realized_returns),
  3. what it SAW          — the point-in-time lens snapshot at decision time (brain/signal_history).

From these it answers the two questions that turn opinion into skill: "when the engine said 60%, was
it right 60%?" (reliability) and "which LENSES/regimes actually predicted?" (lens_edge) — the exact
input a future SELF-CALIBRATING gate consumes to weight lenses by realized edge instead of equal
votes. No resolutions exist until the first cohort matures (~2026-07-17); this is the plumbing so that
cohort is captured cleanly the day it lands.

Append-only JSONL (data/brain/outcome_ledger.jsonl), KEEP-FIRST per thesis_id. Crash-safe / degrade-
never. Decoupled: `realized` may be passed in (to share the track-record's source) or computed via
outcomes.realized_returns (the SAME entry→horizon path-replay grader the track record uses, so the
two halves of the loop can never disagree). Records whose decision predates signal_history carry an
empty lens snapshot —
reliability still works from day one; lens_edge compounds as fully-recorded cohorts resolve.
