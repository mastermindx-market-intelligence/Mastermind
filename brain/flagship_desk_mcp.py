"""The FLAGSHIP judgment desk's MCP surface — a flagship-scoped twin of brain/autonomous_mcp.

The PM-CONVICTION seat (brain/pm_conviction.py) reuses the autonomous Brain's proven research
tools + submit_book FLOW, but it manages the FLAGSHIP book, not the autonomous one. Reusing
brain/autonomous_mcp.build_servers() directly was a bug (caught by the live dry-run): that desk is
hardwired to PORTFOLIO_ID="autonomous", so get_my_book showed the PM the WRONG book and submit_book
wrote to the autonomous book's _pending_decision.json — while pm_conviction read back from
"flagship_judgment", so it always found nothing (ran=False) and would have silently no-op'd the
whole judgment layer in production (and dirtied the autonomous book's pending file).

This module fixes that with two scopes:
  * READ_PORTFOLIO  = "flagship"          — get_my_book shows the PM the REAL Flagship book.
  * SUBMIT_PORTFOLIO = "flagship_judgment" — submit_book writes to an ISOLATED pending path that
    pm_conviction.build_book reads back; phase2's judgment layer then applies it to the Flagship
    paper account. Never collides with the live autonomous book.

The research READ tools are identical to the autonomous desk (the same macro-dashboard surface).
