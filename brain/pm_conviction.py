"""PM-CONVICTION — the armed deep-reasoning portfolio-manager seat.

This is the judgment half of the Flagship deep-reasoning buy layer. Where the engine
(``portfolio.conviction.build``) is a disciplined gate that only DE-escalates, this seat is a
genuine buy-side PM: it takes the engine's confirmed candidates, its rejected pool, the Macro
Strategist's confirmed themes, and the FORGE research summaries, then ANTICIPATES and CHAMPIONS
confirmed-leadership thematic names with conviction — the same posture as the proven autonomous
desk, but constrained to Flagship discipline.

It reuses the PROVEN autonomous tool surface (``brain/autonomous_mcp.py``): identical
regime/themes/baskets/divergences/decision-matrix/quote tools and the ``submit_book`` flow, so the
PM gets the full thematic read. The PM may ADD high-conviction thematic names the engine missed and
DROP engine names that lack a live thesis (real autonomy) — but every name it champions is then run
through the existing blind SENTINEL adversary + a NEXUS-style subtract-only cap pass (orchestrated
by the caller in ``brain/judgment_book.py``; this module exposes the helpers and the no-leverage /
concentration enforcement so the PM's reshaped book is checked, never blindly trusted).

Additive + reversible: gated behind ``MASTERMIND_FLAGSHIP_JUDGMENT`` (default OFF). Returns a book
with ``ran=False`` (or ``None``) on any failure; never raises. Submits to a Flagship-scoped path
(``portfolio_id="flagship_judgment"``) so it can NEVER collide with the live autonomous book.
Model-agnostic via ``role="deep"`` (Opus/Fable resolved by config/agents.yml).
