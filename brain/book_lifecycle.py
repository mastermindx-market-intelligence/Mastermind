"""THE BOOK LIFECYCLE — probation / retire as CIO recommendations (W6 / T2; architecture §2).

The problem this kills (verified in the audits): the US books are ONE BET WEARING FOUR HATS.
Heavyweight was hard-gated to Flagship's universe (an amplifier), Autonomous's active returns
correlate ~0.87 with Flagship, and *nothing measures or polices book orthogonality*. Meanwhile the one
winning book (the user's Self-Directed defensive basket) sits outside the firm's accounting. The
architecture's answer (§2 kill/promote hooks) is a lifecycle: each book earns its capital, and a book
that is a noisy mirror of another — or that loses to its bogey with statistical reliability — is
recommended for retirement.

Three ingredients, all made HONEST AT PAPER-N:

  (a) PER-BOOK GRADES — each book's rolling active return (book minus its bogey) vs three bogeys:
        · SPY (the market),
        · the defensive basket (XLU/XLV/XLF/XLP — the thing that beat us),
        · the regime-conditional max(SPY, defensive) — the bogey a cash/defensive book can win but a
          cash-hoarder in a calm up-tape still loses to,
      plus the book's rolling max-drawdown (surfaced on the card, never an auto-trigger).

  (b) THE ORTHOGONALITY MATRIX — pairwise Pearson correlation of ACTIVE returns (book minus its bogey)
      across the US books over a rolling window. Autonomous persistently >= noisy_mirror_corr vs
      Flagship is the architecture's 'noisy mirror' flag (P9 — a book that is a noisy mirror of another
      is dead weight with extra API costs).

  (c) LIFECYCLE STATES — active -> probation -> retired-recommendation. A book enters probation on
      EITHER (i) `losing_reviews_to_probation` consecutive HAC-significant losing weekly reviews vs its
      regime-conditional bogey, OR (ii) the noisy-mirror flag. A book already on probation that keeps
      failing earns a RETIRED-RECOMMENDATION.

HONEST STATISTICS AT PAPER-N (charter P3/P8) — the load-bearing discipline, mirrored from the posture
governor and cio EXACTLY: a losing-review call requires HAC significance (Newey-West |t| >= hac_t_min)
over an active-return series with `effective_n >= min_effective_n` INDEPENDENT weekly observations. Below
that n the module says `insufficient-n` in the artifact and makes NO recommendation. Same for the
correlation matrix: a pair with fewer than `noisy_mirror_min_pairs` overlapping observations is reported
`insufficient-n`, never a flag.

KILL IS NEVER AUTOMATED (charter P8; architecture §2). This module is display/advisory ONLY: it writes
``data/lifecycle/<date>.json``, feeds the cio weekly note (cio consumes ``lifecycle_summary``), and emits
ONE ``{owner: fable-review}`` improvement-agenda item per probation/retire recommendation. A human/Fable
executes any retirement — nothing here flips a flag, resizes, or trades.

SELF-DIRECTED IS CONSTITUTIONALLY EXEMPT (architecture §2 / charter P6). It is the yardstick — never
killed, never put on probation, never in the orthogonality matrix as a candidate for retirement. This is
hard-coded (``EXEMPT_BOOKS``) and asserted in the tests.

    from brain import book_lifecycle as BL
    rep = BL.review(review_history=...)        # pure, deterministic, injectable
    BL.write(review_history=...)               # + persist data/lifecycle/<date>.json
    summ = BL.lifecycle_summary()              # the compact dict cio + the agenda read

Every input is INJECTED (fixture-driven in tests; derived from the persisted benchmark ledgers in prod).
Nothing here pins a live market state. Best-effort throughout — missing data degrades a book to
`insufficient-n`, never fabricates a grade or a recommendation (charter P2)."""
