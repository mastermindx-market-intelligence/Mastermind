"""The autonomous desk's MCP surface — the FREE-FORM book the Opus Brain manages itself.

Unlike the gated flagship (brain/bot_mcp.execute_trade, which refuses an add without a
CONFIRMED research paper), this desk lets the Brain trade WHATEVER it is convinced of. The
Brain researches (reusing the macro-dashboard READ tools from bot_mcp + WebSearch/WebFetch),
then calls ONE tool — ``submit_book`` — with its complete target portfolio for the day, each
holding carrying a one-paragraph rationale. No gate, no research paper, no sleeves.

The tool does NOT execute the trade itself; it RECORDS the decided book to a per-portfolio
file (``_pending_decision.json``). The deterministic builder (``bot/autonomous.py``) reads it
after the session and rebalances the paper account to those targets under the usual
market-hours discipline — so all the trading logic stays in the trusted Python layer, bound
to the autonomous book only.
