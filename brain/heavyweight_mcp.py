"""The Heavyweight desk's MCP surface — the CONCENTRATED book that presses the firm's best ideas.

Heavyweight is the sibling of the autonomous desk (brain/autonomous_mcp.py), but with two
defining differences:

  1. Its tradable UNIVERSE is the UNION of every published book's latest.json (flagship,
     autonomous, etf) — NOT a Flagship-only mirror. The deterministic builder (``bot/heavyweight.py``)
     DROPS anything the Brain submits that no published book holds. self_directed is EXCLUDED from
     the sourcing union (ruling R1: its book mirrors the defensive yardstick and must not seed HW).
     The rule is enforced in trusted Python, never on the LLM's good behaviour. One-name-per-
     fragility-chain cluster is also enforced (the Brain picks the BEST expression of each theme).
  2. It is given EXPLICIT, read-only visibility into Flagship — ``get_flagship_book`` /
     ``get_flagship_trades`` / ``get_flagship_research`` / ``get_flagship_thinking`` — so the
     Brain can see exactly what Flagship is doing (holdings, blotter, per-name research papers,
     the reasoning trace) and concentrate the firm's highest-conviction, most asymmetric names.

Sizing rails (enforced in Python): each name 5%–50% of NAV, sub-5% nibbles DROPPED, top ~8 names
kept. A name held by ANY published book (flagship, autonomous, or etf) is eligible even if Flagship
does not currently hold it.

Like the autonomous desk, ``submit_book`` only RECORDS the decided book to a per-portfolio file
(``_pending_decision.json``); the trusted layer reads it after the session, enforces the
universe + one-per-cluster + 5–50% sizing rails, and rebalances. The Brain never trades.
Everything is scoped to ``portfolio_id="heavyweight"`` so peer books are only ever READ.

NOTE on visibility vs the autonomous fix: the autonomous Brain had raw Read/Grep/Glob stripped
and read_signal firewalled off the portfolio dirs (it must NOT see other books). Heavyweight is
the deliberate exception — it sees Flagship, but ONLY through these four typed, read-only tools
(it also has no raw Read/Grep/Glob, and read_signal still denies book dirs), so its cross-book
view is intentional and bounded to Flagship.
