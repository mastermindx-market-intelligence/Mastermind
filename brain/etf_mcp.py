"""The ETF desk's MCP surface — the FREE-FORM, ETF-only book the Opus Brain manages itself.

Sibling of ``brain/autonomous_mcp.py``, but the universe is US-listed ETFs ONLY (index / sector /
factor / momentum / duration / cash — ``portfolio.etf_universe``), and the Brain gets a purpose-built
rotation board (``get_etf_board``) that pre-digests the macro dashboard's regime / sector-RS / risk
signals so it doesn't scan 199 engine modules cold. The Brain researches via the macro READ tools +
the board + the web, then calls ONE tool — ``submit_book`` — with its complete target portfolio,
each holding carrying a one-paragraph rationale.

The tool RECORDS the decided book to the etf portfolio's ``_pending_decision.json``; the
deterministic builder (``bot/etf.py``) reads it after the session, RE-ENFORCES the ETF-only
allowlist + the risk guardrails, and rebalances the paper account. All trading logic stays in the
trusted Python layer, bound to the etf book only.

Safety (mirrors the autonomous desk): only the typed ``mcp__bot__*`` / ``mcp__desk__*`` read tools +
web — NO raw Read/Grep/Glob, NO flagship ``get_portfolio``. The Brain reads its OWN book via
``get_my_book`` and cannot reach another book's state. ``submit_book`` drops any non-ETF / off-list
ticker so a single name can never enter this book.
