"""The Research Desk — a full holistic research paper that gates EVERY buy.

This is the discipline the user asked for: before a name the engine wants to buy can
actually be purchased, the Brain writes a complete, human-readable research report on the
company (thesis, pros/cons, valuation, fundamentals, revenue streams, confirmed + pending
catalysts, a *recalculated* forward-earnings view, and other factors), then **re-digests**
that report to confirm the company is still a viable investment AT THIS PRICE. The re-digest
emits a research_score (0-100). That score is combined with the engine "buy score" (the
confluence from the multi-sided decision matrix); only a combined score over the confirm bar
lets the purchase go through — and the combined score also scales the position size, within
the engine's existing per-name cap. Paper-only. The engine still owns the hard vetoes and
the falsifier; a research paper can confirm, veto, or size a buy, but it can never rescue a
hard-vetoed name (parabolic / Altman distress / cycle-blocked).

Two production modes:
  - "llm"    : an ARMED Claude session writes the report (web search + the bot's read tools),
               then a second un-armed pass re-digests it into the verdict JSON. This is the
               default for a NEW buy. Reuses brain.cli_bridge (same path research_desk uses).
  - "engine" : a deterministic report + score composed straight from the decision matrix.
               No network, no tokens — the honest fallback for tests / CI / offline, and for
               carried names that already have a paper.

             Index" shown on the page.

    Rules (doctrine-faithful):
      - combined = round(0.5*engine_score + 0.5*research_score)  [UNCHANGED — score conflation
        is the disease; entry/context stay separate gates, never blended into this combined]
      - BLOCK if combined < the confirm bar, or viability == 'avoid', or (LLM mode and
        the paper does not recommend). A blocked buy is held (size 0) — never executed.
      - `held` lowers the confirm bar by _HELD_HYSTERESIS so a CARRIED position isn't churned
        out on a marginal wobble (a new buy still needs the full CONFIRM_THRESHOLD).
      - When confirmed, size_mult scales the engine weight: 60->0.5 (starter), 80->1.0,
        >=92->1.3 (boost). The caller re-caps at the per-name cap, so a boost never breaches
        the cap; a hard-vetoed name never reaches this gate at all.

    entry_agreement / entry_note are SURFACED (additive, pass-through) from the paper — the
    analyst's read of the injected entry/context evidence, or None when there is no view (older
    cached / deterministic-fallback papers). IMPORTANT ASYMMETRY (house law): this read may only
    DE-ESCALATE a buy. Downstream entry-composition passes entry_agreement + the deterministic
    entry_report to apply_entry_deescalation(), where a 'disagree' downgrades a BUYABLE entry to
    'extended' (park) — an 'agree' can NEVER upgrade a blocked entry. This combined/confirm math is
    deliberately UNTOUCHED by that read (research_score semantics unchanged); the entry axis is a
    separate gate, so the de-escalation lives on the entry verdict, not on `combined`.

RESEARCH_PROMPT = """You are the Research Desk of the Mastermind — an autonomous, paper-only,
narrative investing bot. The engine's signals already want to BUY {ticker}. The desk now runs a
THREE-AXIS discipline — Quality × Entry × Context — and these axes are orthogonal and never
compensatory. THIS paper owns the QUALITY axis: validate the BUSINESS, the VALUATION, the
CATALYSTS, and the FALSIFIERS — is {ticker} a company worth owning, and is this a sound price
for the thesis? Timing authority (is NOW a good entry?) and market-weather authority (is the
weather FOR this cohort?) belong to deterministic engines whose evidence is INJECTED below. Your
job on those two is to SANITY-CHECK and FLAG DISAGREEMENT — engage with the injected evidence and
say whether anything in your business analysis contradicts it — NOT to re-derive the timing or the
context yourself. Today is {asof}; the macro regime is {quad} ({quad_name}). {price_line}

Use your tools first: get_decision_matrix("{ticker}") (address every lens), get_divergences,
get_altdata + get_news (context only), get_quote for the live price. THEN use WebSearch /
WebFetch aggressively for the most recent earnings, guidance, filings, analyst notes,
competitive and macro context.

This is a DEEP-REASONING assignment, not a summary. Go and figure things out: trace causal
chains, follow the money through the supply chain, stress-test the consensus, and reason
several steps ahead. Where you infer rather than observe, tag it (unverified) — but do not
hold back on the inference; that is the value you add over the engine.

Write the report in markdown using EXACTLY these headings (the app parses them):

## Thesis
2-4 sentences: the core investment claim on {ticker}, why now, and the expected outcome.

## Pros
A bulleted list — the strongest reasons to own it (each a concrete, specific point).

## Cons
A bulleted list — the strongest reasons NOT to, including what the bulls are ignoring.

## Valuation
Multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S as relevant), vs history and vs peers, and a fair-value view.

## Fundamentals
Balance sheet, margins, returns on capital, cash generation, debt — the financial health.

## Revenue streams
The actual business: segments, geographic mix, customer concentration, what drives the top line.

## Competitive landscape & moat
Who competes, where {ticker} wins or is vulnerable, and how durable the advantage is. Name the
binding constraint / scarce input the franchise controls (or doesn't).

## Confirmed catalysts
A bulleted list of catalysts that have ALREADY happened or are scheduled/known (with dates).

## Pending catalysts
A bulleted list of known-but-unresolved catalysts and their rough timing/probability.

## Potential catalysts
A bulleted list of SPECULATIVE, not-yet-on-the-radar catalysts you reason could re-rate the
stock up OR down (M&A, product cycles, regulatory shifts, multiple re-rating) — with a rough
probability and the directional impact for each.

## Forward earnings (recalculated)
YOUR re-derived forward estimate — next-year revenue & EPS, the assumptions behind it, and how
it compares to consensus. Show the reasoning, not just a number.

## Bull / base / bear scenarios
Three scenarios with a rough probability and an implied price/return for each, and the single
variable that decides which one plays out.

## Second- and third-order effects
Reason past the obvious. At least 4 specific knock-on points: supply-chain winners/losers,
competitors helped or hurt, customers, credit/refinancing, labor and regulatory ripples — and
who is the non-obvious beneficiary or victim two steps removed.

## Variant perception — what the market is missing
The EDGE: where your analysis differs from consensus and why the disagreement exists (and is it
the edge or the trap). If you have no genuine variant view, say so plainly.

## What to watch
At least 4 concrete, dated/threshold monitoring triggers — earnings dates, data prints, price/
volume levels, guidance bars — that would confirm or break the thesis.

## Other factors
Anything else material: management & capital allocation, sentiment/positioning, governance, ESG/
regulatory, options structure.

## Entry & timing read
REQUIRED (section 17). Engage with the INJECTED entry evidence below (the deterministic ENTRY
ENGINE verdict + metrics). You do NOT own timing — do not re-derive it — but you MUST sanity-check
it against your business analysis: does anything in the thesis, valuation, or catalysts CONTRADICT
what the entry engine says? Call out disagreement explicitly (e.g. the engine calls the entry
buyable but a known catalyst lands next week that argues for waiting, or the engine flags the entry
extended but the thesis is a fresh breakout). If you see nothing that contradicts it, say so plainly.

## Market context fit
REQUIRED (section 18). Engage with the INJECTED context evidence below (NW market weather + the
deterministic CONTEXT GATE: sector heat, rotation, contagion, factor weather). Does the thesis
SURVIVE this weather? Would a cohort-level headwind (a rotation out of the group, contagion into the
sector, a factor the name is exposed to going cold) break the thesis or merely delay it? You do NOT
own the context verdict — sanity-check it and flag any disagreement with your business view.

Discipline: CONFIRMATION over prediction; a story with no price/flow is a value trap. Tag any
inferred input as (unverified). Be blunt; honesty, not alpha. The 13F / smart-money lens is a
LAGGED quarter-end snapshot (filed up to 45 days after the quarter closes): treat it as positioning
CONTEXT only and NEVER tie it to a recent price move — do NOT write "smart money is buying the dip /
accumulating into the selloff / adding on weakness", because the snapshot predates any recent move.
Real-time dip-buying would need Form 4 insider buys, options flow or ETF creations, not 13F. This is
paper-only and nothing you write executes a trade — the engine gates the size and the falsifier.
Output ONLY the markdown report as your final message."""

REDIGEST_PROMPT = """You are the Research Desk re-digesting your OWN research report on {ticker}
to decide whether to confirm the investment AT THIS PRICE ({price_line}). Engine confluence
(the models/signals buy-score) is {confluence:+.2f}.

Re-read the report below, then return ONLY a single fenced ```json block — no prose outside it —
with exactly these fields:
{{
  "research_score": <integer 0-100, your conviction that this is a sound investment AT THIS PRICE>,
  "viability": "compelling" | "fair" | "rich" | "avoid",
  "recommend": true | false,
  "confidence": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "fair_value": <number or null, your fair-value estimate per share>,
  "price_assessment": "<one sentence: is the current price attractive, fair, or rich, and why>",
  "key_risks": ["<the 2-4 risks most likely to break the thesis>"],
  "entry_agreement": "agree" | "caution" | "disagree",
  "entry_note": "<one line: your read of the injected entry/context evidence>",
  "summary": "<one to two sentence verdict>"
}}

Scoring guide: 'compelling' (75+) = sound business at an attractive/fair price; 'fair' (60-74)
= ownable, measured entry; 'rich' (45-59) = good company but priced for perfection, wait;
'avoid' (<45) = do not initiate here. Be honest — a great company at a bad price is not a buy.

entry_agreement is your read of the INJECTED entry/context evidence (above, in the report), NOT a
re-derivation of timing: 'agree' = the injected entry/context evidence looks right and nothing in
your business analysis contradicts it; 'caution' = you have a reservation worth flagging but not a
veto; 'disagree' = the injected entry evidence is too optimistic — you would NOT start a position
here even though the engines allow it. Put the reason in entry_note. NOTE (house law): your
entry_agreement may only DE-ESCALATE a buy — a 'disagree' downgrades a deterministically-buyable
entry, but an 'agree' can NEVER upgrade an entry the engines have blocked. research_score stays
your conviction that this is a sound investment AT THIS PRICE; do not let the entry read move it.
