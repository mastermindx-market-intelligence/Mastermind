"""The HK desk's MCP surface — the FREE-FORM all-China book the Opus Brain manages itself.

Sibling of ``brain/autonomous_mcp.py`` but pointed at the macro China desks and the multi-venue
(A-share / HK / ADR) universe. The Brain researches via the China read tools below + the web,
then calls ONE tool — ``submit_book`` — with its complete target portfolio for the day, each
holding carrying a one-paragraph rationale. No gate, no research paper, no sleeves.

The tool RECORDS the decided book to the china portfolio's ``_pending_decision.json``; the
deterministic builder (``bot/china.py``) reads it after the session and rebalances the paper
account (USD-marked) to those targets. All trading logic stays in the trusted Python layer,
bound to the china book only.

Safety (mirrors the autonomous desk): only typed ``mcp__china__*`` read tools + web — NO raw
Read/Grep/Glob, NO flagship get_portfolio, NO gated execute_trade. The Brain reads its OWN book
via get_my_book and cannot reach another book's state.
