"""FAST DE-RISK TRIGGER — react to a CONFIRMED unwind off-schedule, not at the next post-close run.

The desk decides once per day, post-close. On 2026-06-23 that was too slow: the AI-buildout/semis
chain cracked intraday (SMH −7%, DRAM −14%) and the held book sat in it until the once-daily run. This
module is the fast reflex the desk lacked. A DETERMINISTIC, free (no-LLM) ``tripwire`` fuses three
confirmations of an unwind — a −X% theme day on the book's fragile chain, a SPY dealer-gamma FLIP, a
credit gap — together with the Macro Risk Officer's risk state and the live overnight tape. When it
fires, the desk de-risks IMMEDIATELY, subtract-only:

  * ``derisk_brain``    — revises a Brain book's queued ``pending_target`` down to the gross cap and
    away from the cracking chains, so it settles defensively at the next open. No LLM needed (it fires
    even when the model is down — the whole point).

Flagship and Heavyweight cutter implementations remain below for historical audit and unit-level
regression, but an archive guard freezes them before any tripwire, price, artifact, or account write.

Flag-gated behind ``MASTERMIND_FAST_DERISK`` (default OFF → the scheduler hooks are inert and the books
are byte-identical to today). The macro-risk teeth themselves are gated on ``MASTERMIND_MACRO_RISK``.
Additive + reversible; NEVER raises into the scheduler.

# HEAVYWEIGHT — off-cycle subtract-only cut of the held concentrated book to the gross cap.
#
# Historical implementation note: Heavyweight (bot/heavyweight.py) is a HELD book that rebalanced
# directly at close via
# paper_account.rebalance(..., portfolio_id="heavyweight") and NEVER queues a pending_target. So the
# "just add it to sweep_us()" one-liner that routes a book through derisk_brain would be a silent
# no-op here ("nothing_queued"). Before retirement this was its off-ramp — a HELD-book cutter mirroring
# derisk_flagship, scoped to portfolio_id="heavyweight" and its single "heavy" sleeve.
#
# Parity with derisk_flagship: SAME tripwire, SAME severity-derived eff_cap (min(state_cap, sev_cap)
# + posture notch), SAME worst-loser/cracking-chain-first ordering, SAME REAL paper exits
# (paper_account.execute_fill — the mechanism heavyweight itself uses to reduce a line at rebalance),
# SAME fail-soft telemetry shape. The ONE deliberate divergence: heavyweight does NOT route exits
# through risk_officer.apply_exits. That guard is CONVICTION-ONLY (its _held_map filters to
# sleeve=='conviction'), so a "heavy"-sleeve book would be filtered to zero held names → zero exits.
# Heavyweight is single-sleeve with its own concentration doctrine and no ½-Kelly minimum-invested
# floor — exactly the case flagship's LEADERSHIP sleeve is in, which also bypasses risk_officer.
# The never-blow-to-cash property is structural: the cut stops the instant gross ≤ eff_cap (0.55–0.70),
# so it always leaves 30–45% invested — it can never liquidate the book to cash. The archive guard
# now returns before any of this implementation runs.
