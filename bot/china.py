"""The China portfolio — a free-form Opus Brain managing its own $1M all-China paper book.

The Greater-China sibling of ``bot/autonomous.py``. Once per Asia trading day (after the
A-share close), the China Brain:
  1. sees its current book (cash, holdings, live USD P&L) + the China macro regime,
  2. researches freely — the macro-dashboard China desks (regime, standouts, intake, brief)
     OR web search, its choice,
  3. submits a COMPLETE target book, one rationale per holding (no gate, no research paper),
  4. and the deterministic layer rebalances the paper account to those weights at the latest
     close, marks NAV in CNY vs FXI (iShares China Large-Cap, marked in CNY), and logs the day.

The universe is ALL of Greater China: mainland A-shares (``*.SS`` / ``*.SZ``, quoted CNY), Hong
Kong (``*.HK``, HKD), and US-listed China ADRs (USD). The book's base currency is **CNY**:
A-shares are native, while HK (HKD) and ADR (USD) prices are converted to CNY at the prevailing
rate (``portfolio.fx.usd_to_cny`` over the shared price store) so the single-currency NAV stays
honest. Everything is scoped to portfolio_id="china" so no other book is touched.

Run:  python -m bot.china        (or the APScheduler 'china_daily' job, or POST /api/china/run)
