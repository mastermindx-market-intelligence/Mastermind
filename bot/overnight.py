"""The overnight watch loop — let the Brain books re-decide on the LIVE overnight tape before the open.

A human trader watches the overnight tape (US index futures, the Asia→Europe handoff, vol) and adjusts
their open position as it develops. The Brain books, by contrast, decide ONCE post-close and queue a
target (``bot/settle.py``) that settles at the open. This module lets them KEEP WATCHING: on a
scheduled overnight tick it reads the live tape (``data_layer.overnight``); if the tape is MATERIAL —
a deterministic tripwire (overnight risk elevated/stressed; free, no LLM) — it re-prompts the book's
Brain (Opus) with an overnight directive built from the tape, which REVISES the queued target. The
revised target then settles at the open via the existing queue→settle machinery.

Cheap by construction: the deterministic tripwire gates the Opus call, so the Brain fires only on a
material overnight move (~a couple nights a week), never on a calm tape. Never raises into the scheduler.
