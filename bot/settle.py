"""Market-hours discipline for the free-form Brain books — queue on close, settle at the open.

The Brain books (autonomous, etf, china, hk) each submit a COMPLETE target book once per trading
day, AFTER their market's close. Booking those as instantaneous fills at a stale / overnight price
is wrong — and re-running the build churns the book with phantom trims. Instead each book's run
calls ``execute_or_queue``: when its market is OPEN it rebalances at the live mark (real fills); when
CLOSED it QUEUES the decided target (``paper_account.save_pending_target``) and books NOTHING. The
scheduler then calls ``settle_open`` at the next open, which fills the queued target with ONE
rebalance at the live open marks. This mirrors the flagship's queue_orders/fill_pending discipline
(bot/phase2.py), generalized to a full target (sells + trims + buys) via ``paper_account.settle_target``.

**Open-price semantics (A4a fix):** the settle job runs at ~15:00 UTC (10 am ET), which means
``yahoo_feed.warm`` returns the LAST print of the still-open partial-day bar rather than the
true session open (9:30 ET), while the flagship (phase2.py) fills via ``paper_account.fill_pending``
which inherits the live mark at queue time — roughly the open.  To unify semantics, the USD-book
``_price`` helper now tries:
  1. ``polygon.day_open(ticker)`` — the snapshot ``day.o`` field, the flagship's semantic.
  2. ``yahoo_feed.open_price_local(ticker)`` — the latest daily bar's Open column.
  3. ``paper_account._current_price(ticker)`` — today's Close/last (previous behaviour).
Each fill gets a ``fill_price_source`` stamp (``polygon_open`` / ``yahoo_open`` / ``last_price``)
so mixed semantics are at least auditable when the fallback fires.

Calendars: the US books (autonomous, etf) use ``portfolio.market_calendar`` (NYSE); the Greater-China
books (china, hk) use ``portfolio.china_calendar`` (A-share session). Both expose ``is_open()``.
