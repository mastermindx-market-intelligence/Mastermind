"""Shared decision-log row semantics for the Brain books (hk / china / etf / autonomous /
heavyweight).

Every Brain book keeps ``decisions.jsonl`` idempotent per ``asof``: a re-run for a date drops
the existing row(s) for that date and appends the new one. That rule is right for a *better*
re-run and catastrophic for a *failed* one.

2026-07-24, HK: the 09:00 UTC scheduled run produced a real book (10 holdings, packet
``ed5dd3359d9dbe53``). At 14:20 the ``watch_asia_overnight`` job re-ran the same brain in
OVERNIGHT REVIEW mode; the LLM call died on ``"You've hit your session limit"``, and the error
stub it wrote for the same ``asof`` **erased that day's book** — the successful run left no
trace in ``decisions.jsonl``. The book looked "not fired since the 22nd" when it had in fact
fired and been overwritten.

The rule here: **a barren row may never supersede a substantive one for the same date.** A
failed re-run is a non-event for the ledger — the failure is already recorded in the run log
(``brain.runlog`` / ``run_events.jsonl``), which is where errors belong. A substantive re-run
still supersedes freely, so a genuinely better book replaces an earlier one as before.
