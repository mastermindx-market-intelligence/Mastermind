"""Historical Flagship daily loop — archived and operationally disabled.

``run_daily`` returns a stable archive no-op before refreshes, market reads, model calls, or writes.
The scheduler no longer registers it and POST /daily returns HTTP 410. The implementation below is
retained for auditability of the old portfolio's mechanics.

When explicitly enabled in an isolated legacy test it runs, in order:
  0a. Deploy-lag tripwire: alert (LOUD) when production trails master >24h. Never raises.
  0b. Freshen the vendored macro analyzer data before the engine reads it.
  1.  Gated multi-name paper book (phase2, material-change gated).
  2.  Armed Claude regime/theme research -> proposals gated into the falsifiable ledger.

Successor: ``bot.autonomous.run_autonomous`` / POST ``/api/autonomous/run``.
