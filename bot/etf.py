"""The ETF book — a free-form Opus Brain rotating its own $1M paper book across US-listed ETFs.

The US-ETF sibling of ``bot/autonomous.py``: once per US trading day (after the close), the Brain
  1. reads the ETF ROTATION BOARD (``get_etf_board`` — the dashboard's regime / sector-RS / risk
     signals pre-digested) + its current book,
  2. researches freely (the macro desks + the board, or the web — its choice),
  3. submits a COMPLETE target book over US-listed ETFs ONLY, one rationale per holding,
  4. and the deterministic layer RE-ENFORCES the ETF-only universe + the risk guardrails, rebalances
     the paper account to those weights at the latest close, marks NAV vs SPY, and logs the day.

The difference from the naked autonomous book is DISCIPLINE, not signals: the Brain is handed an
ETF-adapted doctrine (confirmation over prediction, a regime→tilt map, cash-is-a-position, a crisis
ladder into duration/T-bills, three exit stops) and the trusted layer enforces a few hard guardrails
the Brain cannot override — an ETF-only allowlist, a single-ETF cap, a turnover throttle, and a
crisis floor that caps offensive gross when the dashboard reads stressed. The engine disciplines;
Opus decides. Universe + pricing live in ``portfolio.etf_universe``; the board in ``brain.etf_board``.
Everything is scoped to portfolio_id="etf" so no other book is touched.

Run:  python -m bot.etf        (or the APScheduler 'etf_daily' job, or POST /api/etf/run)

_DEFAULT_DOCTRINE = (
    "1. CONFIRMATION OVER PREDICTION, BUT NOT CHASING. You cannot time ignition. Prefer ETFs ALREADY "
    "ranked high in the board's sector_rs table AND above their 200d trend; do not buy a falling knife "
    "on a narrative. BUT a 'leader' already +40-60% above its 200d at the 100th percentile is a parabola "
    "to size DOWN, not press — the desk clamps an over-extended name's weight regardless.\n"
    "2. REGIME->TILT, conditioned on the tape. Use the board's quad: Q1 Goldilocks -> lean growth/tech/"
    "momentum (XLK QQQ SMH MTUM QUAL); Q2 Reflation -> cyclicals/value/energy/materials (XLE XLF XLB "
    "VLUE IWM); Q3 Stagflation -> energy/defensives/short-duration (XLE XLU XLP + SGOV/SHY); Q4 Growth-"
    "scare -> defensives/duration/min-vol (XLU XLP XLV TLT USMV + cash). A PRIOR — defer to sector_rs "
    "and trend when the tape disagrees.\n"
    "3. CASH IS A POSITION, AND A CALM TAPE IS NOT A BUY SIGNAL. Hold T-bill ETFs (SGOV/BIL) deliberately "
    "as the option premium that funds rotation; do not be reflexively fully invested. A 'calm' risk_state "
    "is coincident — NOT a reason to spend the buffer into strength, especially with fragility lit.\n"
    "4. CRISIS LADDER. When the board's risk_state is ELEVATED or STRESSED, de-gross into duration "
    "(TLT/IEF), T-bill cash (SGOV/BIL) and optionally gold (GLD). The desk caps offensive gross in a "
    "stressed read regardless — get there first, deliberately.\n"
    "5. THREE EXIT STOPS per holding, set on entry: a trend break (below its 200d), a thesis "
    "invalidation (the regime/leadership that justified it flips), and a time stop (dead capital "
    "lagging the leader gets rotated). Never average down into a name diverging from a rotating tape.\n"
    "6. READ THE FRAGILITY BLOCK — it LEADS, risk_state LAGS. Negative GEX (dealers amplify selloffs), "
    "breadth divergence, cross-asset concentration and per-name take-profit flags front-run the "
    "coincident gauges; when they light up, de-gross AHEAD of risk_state even on a 'calm' read.\n"
    "7. NO SINGLE-FACTOR CONCENTRATION. SPY/QQQ/SMH/MTUM are mostly ONE megacap-growth/semis factor — a "
    "'diversified' 7-name book can fall as one. Watch real factor exposure, not line count; the desk "
    "caps the growth/semis/momentum cluster's combined gross. Diversify with duration/bills/defensives/"
