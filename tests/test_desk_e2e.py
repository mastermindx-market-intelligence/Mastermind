"""END-TO-END integration smoke test for the FLAGSHIP judgment desk.

Unlike ``tests/test_judgment_book.py`` — which mocks the seat FUNCTIONS wholesale
(``strategist.run`` / ``pm_conviction.build_book`` / ``committee.assess`` are replaced with
lambdas, so NO seat logic ever runs) — this test runs the REAL pipeline and fakes ONLY the
LLM transport + the desk submission I/O. That is the seam where the bug class we hit manually
lives: the PM submit-path mismatch (``pm_conviction.build_book`` read ``portfolio_id=
"flagship_judgment"`` while the desk's ``submit_book`` wrote to ``"autonomous"`` → build_book
always read nothing → ran=False → the judgment layer silently no-op'd in production).

WHAT IS REAL (executes its true code):
  * ``brain.judgment_book.build`` — the full orchestrator (strategist → PM → per-name committee
    → gate officer → name_cap clamp → shadow re-emit).
  * ``brain.strategist`` — real ``_strategist_input`` builder + ``strategist_assess`` parser
    (runs on real-shaped dashboard JSON; only ``_load`` returns synthetic data).
  * ``brain.pm_conviction.build_book`` — real ``_pm_input`` + ``_build_prompt`` + the
    clear_submission → cli_bridge.reason → read_submission lifecycle + holdings normalisation.
  * ``brain.flagship_desk_mcp`` — the REAL ``submit_book`` tool + ``submission_path`` /
    ``clear_submission`` / ``read_submission`` path helpers (only redirected to a tmp data dir
    so nothing touches the live book). This is the exact write/read seam the bug was in.
  * ``brain.committee.assess`` — real SENTINEL input builder + NEXUS subtract-only synthesis.
  * ``brain.gate_officer`` — real ``_gate_input`` + ``gate_assess`` + the pure ``apply_gate``
    subtract-only reshaper.

WHAT IS FAKED (the LLM/network boundary ONLY — so the test is offline, fast, and can't hang):
  * ``brain.client.available`` → True, ``brain.client.call_model`` → a fake that inspects the
    SYSTEM PROMPT and returns canned VALID JSON for whichever seat called it.
  * ``brain.cli_bridge.reason`` (async) → instead of spawning a headless Claude session it
    WRITES a canned PM target book through the REAL desk ``submit_book`` tool (simulating
    ``mcp__desk__submit_book`` to the ``flagship_judgment`` path) then returns "submitted".
  * ``flagship_desk_mcp.build_servers`` / ``allowed_tools`` → no-ops (no real MCP server spun).
  * the dashboard ``_load`` helpers (strategist + lenses) → synthetic real-shaped data so the
    REAL input builders + JSON parsers run end-to-end.

If ANY real LLM / MCP call escaped the fakes the test would hang; it completes in well under a
second, which is itself the no-hang proof.
